📌 NY Taxi Dash Assignment (Question-Based Format)
Objective
Students will create an interactive Dash web app to analyze the NYC Taxi dataset. The app should provide filters, visualizations, and insights based on user inputs.

📌 Assignment Questions & Tasks
1️⃣ Data Overview & Loading
✅ Load the NYC Taxi dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
🔹 Q1: How many total trips are in the dataset?
🔹 Q2: What are the unique taxi vendors in the dataset?

💡 Hint: Use .shape, .unique(), and .value_counts().

2️⃣ Interactive Dashboard Filters
✅ Create a sidebar with filters:

Dropdown: Filter by taxi vendor (VendorID)
Slider: Filter by fare amount (fare_amount)
Date Picker: Select a range of pickup dates (pickup_datetime)
🔹 Q3: How do different taxi vendors impact trip distribution?
🔹 Q4: What is the average fare amount based on user-selected filters?

💡 Hint: Use Dash components like dcc.Dropdown, dcc.Slider, and dcc.DatePickerRange.

3️⃣ Visualizations & Analysis
✅ Implement three charts:

A) Pickup Locations Map
🔹 Q5: Display a scatter plot of trip pickup locations.

Use longitude & latitude from (pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude).
Color points by VendorID.
💡 Hint: Use px.scatter_mapbox() from Plotly.

B) Fare Amount Distribution
🔹 Q6: Show a histogram of fare_amount to analyze pricing trends.

Compare distribution for different vendors.
💡 Hint: Use px.histogram().

C) Trip Duration vs Distance
🔹 Q7: Create a scatter plot of trip duration vs. distance.

trip_distance on X-axis, trip_duration on Y-axis.
Color by payment type.
💡 Hint: Use px.scatter().

4️⃣ Data Table & Summary Metrics
✅ Show a data table with filtered trip records.
✅ Display key statistics:

Total trips
Average fare
Most common payment method
🔹 Q8: What is the most frequent payment method used?
🔹 Q9: Which pickup location has the highest trip frequency?

💡 Hint: Use dash_table.DataTable() and .mode() for most frequent values.

5️⃣ Bonus Challenge 🚀 (Optional)
✅ Implement a heatmap of NYC trip density.
✅ Allow users to switch between different fare categories.
✅ Predict fare amount using a simple regression model.

🔹 Q10: Can you identify peak hours for NYC taxis?

💡 Hint: Use px.density_mapbox() for heatmaps.

📌 Submission Instructions
File: Submit your Python script (app.py) and dataset (ny_taxi.csv).
Run the app and test all interactions before submission.
Upload your final project to GitHub or a ZIP file.
